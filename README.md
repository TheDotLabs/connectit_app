# Connect IT

A startup platform where people can view the whole new startups which are at idea stage or they have just landed.
Developed by Ayush P Gupta(Founder) and Radhey Shyam, the two graduates from IIT Roorkee.

## PROBLEM

Small startups which are at idea level or just startup are not showcased anywhere, mainly
because existing platforms are flooded with well established startups which have good recurring
revenue and prolific team size. There isn't any place except some groups on social media where
one can share his idea or his early staged startup with like minded people. Mainly college
freshers or those who lack experience face a lot of challenge in networking, mentoring, building
a startup. Nearly all of them fail not because they didn't have idea but they lack resources
especially finding team mates

## SOLUTION

Our core focus in only on small scale startups which are idea level or which have just started
like having team of 2-4 people. By focusing on this segment we can have a gallery of upcoming,
new startups so that people are enthusiastic of knowing startups or those who are willing to join
others can benefit out the same.
There are three broad sections in our app:
1. Startup showcase page
2. Feeds section
3. Talent search page

## How do you differentiate yourself from the competition?
By focusing on only small startups which are at idea level, or just started we create a line of
separation from our competitors

## VISION

To create a complete startup ecosystem or basically a startup kit for a startup. We will . have
investors, mentors, incubators, accelerators, summits on our platform which are essential for
early stage startups
